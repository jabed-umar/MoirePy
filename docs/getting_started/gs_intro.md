# Getting Started

This section will walk you through the key steps to begin using MoirePy — from installing the package to preparing custom lattice structures and building moiré superlattices. By the end of this section, you'll be ready to run your own simulations or dive into the provided example notebooks.

If you’re new to the physics behind moiré systems, we recommend visiting the [Theoretical Background](../theory/theory_intro.md) section for motivation and foundational concepts.

## Contents

### [Installation](installation.md)
Learn how to install **MoirePy**.

### [Prepare Layers](prepare_layers.md)
Understand how to define **custom 2D layers** using the `Layer` class. You’ll also explore inbuilt lattice templates available in MoirePy for quick prototyping and testing.

### [Moiré Lattice and Hamiltonian](moire_lattice_and_hamiltonian.md)
Learn how to **combine two layers into a moiré superlattice**, and construct both **real space** and **k-space Hamiltonians** for the moiré lattice. We also learn how to customise hopping terms.

Once you're familiar with these basics, you’ll be ready to explore more advanced features — including quantum transport, non-Hermitian systems, and large-scale simulations using commensurate lattice tools.
