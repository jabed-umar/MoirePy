# Installation

You can install the `moirepy` library using pip from the [official PyPI library](https://pypi.org/project/moirepy/), the standard package installer for Python. This guide provides detailed installation instructions for various operating systems and environments.

## Prerequisites

Before installing `moirepy`, ensure that you have the following:

* **Python:** It is highly recommended to use Python 3.12. While `moirepy` is generally compatible with Python versions greater than 3.7, comprehensive testing has been performed primarily with Python 3.12. Using this version will provide the most stable and reliable experience.
* **pip:** Pip usually comes bundled with Python installations. You can check if you have pip installed by opening your terminal or command prompt and running:

```bash
pip --version
```

If pip is not installed, you can find installation instructions in the official Python documentation [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## Installation Instructions

The most common way to install `moirepy` is using pip. Follow the instructions below for your operating system.

**Linux / macOS / Windows**

```bash

or

```

or
