# Preparing Moiré Lattice and it's Hamiltonian

In the previous section, we learned how to prepare a lattice layer using the `Layer` class. Now, we will extend this knowledge to create a Moiré lattice and its Hamiltonian.

## Moiré Lattice

Assuming you have written your own `Layer` subclasses, for this tutorial we will use the inbuilt `TriangleLayer` for simplicity.

We have not seen any commensurate Moiré lattices where
